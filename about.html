      <p class="padded">My name is Julia, I am 29, a marketer and founder of thebackpackway.<br /><br />People who travel the world for living always fascinated me. In my mid-twenties I decided to become one of those travelers. After a life-changing moment I had to learn to be in harmony and happy with myself again. Which encouraged me even more to take a leap and travel the world.

      <p class="padded">Planning my first solo trip I decided to write my adventures down. My first intention was to keep my family and friends posted (since especially my grand ma was really worried). But after some posts I wanted to share more of my experiences with other travellers. I got a lot of helpful information from bloggers sharing their ups and also downs personally or on their blogs.This was the birth of thebackpackway!<br /><br />
      I hope you guys enjoy reading about my travels and lifestyle tips!
